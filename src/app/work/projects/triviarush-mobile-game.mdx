## Overview

TriviaRush is a real-time multiplayer trivia game where players compete in live trivia challenges, collect game rewards, and build their social gaming network. The project was developed using **React Native (Expo)** for the mobile app and **Nest.js** for the backend, with **Socket.IO** for real-time event handling. The system supports **Google Authentication**, **secure user settings storage**, and **player statistics tracking**.

This project showcases my expertise in **Next.js, React Native, and Nest.js**, emphasizing scalable architecture, real-time WebSocket communication, and optimized backend services.

## Key Features

### üéÆ **Real-Time Multiplayer Trivia**
- Players can join game rooms and compete in **live trivia matches**.
- **Socket.IO integration** ensures seamless real-time event updates.

### ‚ö° **Efficient WebSocket Event Handling**
- Batch processing for response submissions to handle **millions of concurrent events**.
- Mutex locks and Redis caching to **prevent duplicate actions** (e.g., duplicate game rooms).

### üîê **Authentication & Security**
- **Google Authentication** integration.
- **JWT & Passport-based authentication** for secure API access.
- Device-based authentication restrictions with a **"multiple devices allowed"** setting.

### üõ† **Dynamic In-App Settings**
- Users can **customize their trivia experience**, including:
  - **Game preferences** (topics, difficulty levels).
  - **Sound settings** (background music, sound effects).
  - **Account security** (2FA, email change requests).
  - **Social connections** (adding game pals for frequent matches).
- Secure settings storage via **Expo SecureStore** and server synchronization.

### üìä **Player Stats & Leaderboard**
- Players' **scores, response time, and fastest answers** are stored in **MySQL (Prisma ORM)**.
- The server computes **leaderboard rankings** in real-time and emits updates via WebSockets.

### üöÄ **Optimized Backend & Database Design**
- Built with **Nest.js**, using **Prisma ORM** with **MySQL**.
- **Redis caching** improves performance for frequently accessed data.
- WebSocket events **batch processed efficiently** to reduce database write operations.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend (Expo - React Native)**
- **React Native (Expo 51)**: For a smooth cross-platform mobile experience.
- **Socket.IO Client**: For real-time communication.
- **NativeWind & React Native Paper**: For styling and UI components.
- **Google Authentication**: For secure sign-ins.
- **TypeScript**: For a strongly-typed, maintainable codebase.

### **Backend (Nest.js)**
- **Nest.js**: Modular and scalable backend framework.
- **Socket.IO Server**: Handles real-time multiplayer events.
- **Prisma ORM**: For efficient MySQL database management.
- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data.
- **Passport.js & JWT**: For authentication and authorization.

## Challenges and Learnings

### **Handling Large-Scale Real-Time Events**
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring **efficient real-time event handling**. With potentially millions of simultaneous players, WebSocket events needed to be optimized. This was solved by:
- **Batch processing player responses** before database writes.
- **Using Redis** to cache leaderboard data instead of constantly querying MySQL.
- **Mutex locks** to prevent duplicate WebSocket event handling.

### **Ensuring Data Consistency Across Devices**
With the **"multiple devices allowed"** setting, ensuring **user session validity** was crucial. The backend was designed to:
- **Limit simultaneous logins** if the setting was disabled.
- Track active sessions and revoke **old device sessions** upon new logins.

### **Designing a Scalable Game Room System**
To prevent **duplicate rooms**, a **Redis-based locking mechanism** was implemented. If multiple users attempted to create the same room, the system **ensured only one instance was created**.

## Outcome

TriviaRush is now fully optimized for **real-time multiplayer gameplay**, handling concurrent players **efficiently and securely**. This project demonstrates my **full-stack capabilities**, particularly in:
- **Building real-time React Native apps with WebSockets.**
- **Optimizing Nest.js backend for high-performance gaming applications.**
- **Designing secure authentication & settings management systems.**

This experience solidifies my expertise in **Next.js, React Native, and Nest.js**, making me a strong candidate for real-time app development roles.
