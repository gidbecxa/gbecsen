## Overview

**Harpiee** is a **next-generation social media platform** designed to foster happiness and meaningful connections. It allows users to share **micro gratitude posts, engage with an interactive feed, and track engagement statistics.**  

As the **Lead Developer & Designer**, I built Harpiee from the ground up, focusing on **scalability, performance, and a seamless user experience** across mobile and web platforms. The app was developed using:
- **React Native (Expo 51)** for the mobile app.
- **Next.js** for the Harpiee web platform.
- **Nest.js** for the backend, powered by AWS cloud infrastructure.

Harpiee leverages **AWS S3 for media storage, PostgreSQL on AWS RDS for the database, and Google Cloud Messaging for push notifications**. I also implemented **video compression and optimization on the server side** to ensure efficient content delivery.

## Key Features

### üé≠ **Unique Social Engagement Model**
- Users connect through a **custom relationship system** (beyond 'Follow' or 'Add Friend').
- Connection types dictate **content visibility rules**, affecting feed dynamics.

### üìä **Advanced Stats & Analytics**
- Users can track **impressions, likes, and engagement metrics** for their posts.
- Data visualization using **charts and interactive UI elements**.
- Built a **scalable stats API** to handle large datasets efficiently.

### üé• **Video Upload, Compression & Optimization**
- Users can upload **short videos** that are **compressed and optimized** on the backend before being stored on **AWS S3**.
- Implemented server-side **video compression** using `ffmpeg` to reduce load times while maintaining quality.
- Optimized video streaming to ensure **smooth playback**.
- Integration with `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` for efficient **video trimming and processing**.

### üîî **Push Notifications & Real-Time Updates**
- Integrated **Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)** for **real-time push notifications**.
- Notifications for **likes, comments, and user interactions**.

### üîê **Secure Authentication & User Management**
- **Clerk** for authentication, ensuring **secure user signups & logins**.
- **OAuth & social logins** for a seamless onboarding experience.
- Role-based permissions and **data access security**.

### üèó **Scalable Backend Infrastructure**
- **Nest.js** backend hosted on **AWS EC2** (Amazon Linux 2023).
- **PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS** for reliability and performance.
- Efficient **query optimization and indexing** for fast API responses.
- **AWS S3** for cloud storage and optimized **file serving**.

### üìÇ **Cloud Storage & Content Management**
