## Overview

Messibites is a **crypto-powered space adventure game** featuring a procedurally generated universe, Web3 mechanics, and an engaging player economy. Alongside the game, I developed a **Next.js-powered website** to provide a seamless onboarding experience, track player progress, and handle in-game purchases securely using PayPal.

## Key Features

### üéÆ The Game
- **Procedurally Generated Space**: The game world consists of dynamic starfields, nebula effects, and parallax layers, creating an immersive space environment.
- **Player Economy & Collectibles**: Players navigate through realms, collect gemstones of varying values, and manage resources like gas and energy.
- **Obstacles & Challenges**: Space stations, energy vortexes, and brimstone obstacles add strategic depth to gameplay.
- **HUD & Real-Time Stats**: The game‚Äôs HUD dynamically updates player stats, realm information, and collectible values.

### üåê The Website
- **Built with Next.js**: Ensured lightning-fast performance, efficient data fetching, and SEO optimization.
- **Authentication with Clerk**: Secure user sign-in and identity management.
- **Firestore Integration**: Real-time user data storage for tracking purchases and game progress.
- **PayPal Payment Flow**: Implemented an **auto-return system** that securely credits in-game currency after a successful PayPal transaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For a high-performance, server-rendered web experience.
- **Clerk**: For authentication and seamless user management.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Real-time database for storing player progress and purchases.
- **Godot 4.3**: For developing the 2D space adventure with procedural elements.
- **PayPal API**: For handling secure in-game purchases.
- **React & Tailwind CSS**: To ensure a modern, responsive UI for the website.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Seamless Payment Integration**: Handling PayPal‚Äôs **auto-return URL flow** required careful synchronization with Firestore to ensure credits were properly allocated.
- **Procedural Generation Complexity**: Crafting a **realistic space environment** using Godot‚Äôs shaders and particle systems demanded significant fine-tuning.
- **Real-Time HUD Updates**: Ensuring smooth updates to **game stats, energy levels, and realm info** required efficient event handling in Godot.

## Outcome

The project successfully combined **Next.js for the web platform** and **Godot for the game**, creating a seamless experience for players. The **Next.js-powered website** ensures **fast performance, secure transactions, and real-time tracking**, making it an essential companion to the Messibites game.

üöÄ **Messibites is not just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience that merges Web3 mechanics, real-time interactivity, and engaging gameplay.**
