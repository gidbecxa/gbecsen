## Overview

This **Enterprise Expense Tracker** is a web-based financial management system designed for businesses to **streamline expense reporting, approval workflows, and user management**. Built with **Next.js and Supabase**, the platform ensures a **secure, scalable, and intuitive SaaS experience**.

The project demanded a **high level of security**, featuring **role-based authentication, protected routes, and data integrity measures**. I implemented **an optimized database schema and efficient UI/UX workflows**, ensuring a smooth user experience for employees, accountants, and admins.

This project highlights my expertise in **Next.js, database optimization, security-first architecture, and intuitive SaaS UI/UX design**.

## Key Features

### 🏢 **Expense Management for Enterprises**
- Employees can **log and track company-related spendings**.
- Accountants can **review, approve, or disapprove expenses**.
- Admins oversee **user roles, access management, and system configurations**.

### 🔐 **Security & Role-Based Access Control**
- **Supabase Authentication** for secure user sign-ins.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
  - 🚀 **Employees**: Access personal dashboards & submit expenses.
  - 📊 **Accountants**: Audit expenses with approval & comments.
  - 🛠️ **Admins**: Manage users and permissions.
- **Protected API routes** ensure that users only access authorized data.

### 🖥️ **Sleek & Intuitive SaaS UI**
- **Designed with Tailwind CSS & NextUI** for a modern, responsive experience.
- **Optimized dashboards** for different roles (Employee, Accountant, Admin).
- **Intuitive expense submission & approval workflow**.

### 🚀 **Scalable Backend with Supabase**
- **PostgreSQL database** designed for **high-performance queries**.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** policies for fine-grained access control.
- **Database indexes** optimized for fast retrieval of financial records.

### 📊 **Audit & Compliance Features**
- **Expense logs** track all changes for compliance and security.
- **Timestamped approvals & rejections** for accountability.
- **Data encryption** ensures sensitive financial data is protected.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend (Next.js)**
- **Next.js 14**: Optimized for performance and scalability.
- **React Query**: Efficient API caching and state management.
- **NextUI & Tailwind CSS**: Aesthetic, accessible UI design.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

### **Backend (Supabase - PostgreSQL)**
- **Supabase Authentication**: Secure and seamless login flow.
- **PostgreSQL**: Scalable relational database for structured data.
- **Supabase Storage**: Secure handling of receipt and document uploads.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Restricting access at a database level.

## Challenges & Solutions

### **🔐 Security & Role-Based Access**
Since financial data is highly sensitive, I implemented **multi-layered security**:
- **Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase** to prevent unauthorized data access.
- **Strict role-based route protection in Next.js**.
- **Optimized authentication flow** to ensure session integrity.

### **📊 Database Optimization for Fast Queries**
Handling **large datasets of financial records** required:
- **Indexing frequently queried columns** (e.g., expense dates, amounts).
- **Optimizing API requests** to avoid redundant queries.
- **Efficient pagination & lazy-loading strategies**.

### **🛠️ Seamless User Experience**
Building a SaaS product for **finance teams** meant designing an interface that was:
- **Effortless for employees** to log expenses quickly.
- **Data-rich yet intuitive** for accountants to review spendings.
- **Admin-friendly** for managing company-wide user access.

## Outcome

The **Enterprise Expense Tracker** delivers a **secure, scalable, and user-friendly** solution for businesses to manage corporate spending. 

This project reinforces my expertise in:
- **Developing Next.js SaaS applications with security-first design**.
- **Optimizing database performance in Supabase/PostgreSQL**.
- **Designing intuitive UI/UX workflows for financial applications**.
