Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on various projectsâ€”social apps, business tools, and e-commerce platformsâ€”and one thing has remained constant: my go-to stack. React Native, Next.js, and Nest.js have become my default choices for building scalable, high-performance applications, whether itâ€™s a social media platform like Harpiee, a business tool like the Expenses Tracker, or a matchmaking service like DMORAU. 

## Why This Stack?  

The tech world is filled with frameworks and tools, but this combination has proven to be the most versatile and efficient for my workflow. Each piece plays a critical role:  

- **React Native** â€“ The backbone of my mobile app development, ensuring smooth cross-platform performance.  
- **Next.js** â€“ The perfect framework for building fast, SEO-friendly web apps.  
- **Nest.js** â€“ A scalable backend framework that brings structure to API development.  

Together, they provide a seamless full-stack experience that balances flexibility, performance, and maintainability.  

## React Native: One Codebase, Two Platforms  

When I first started working on mobile apps, managing separate codebases for iOS and Android felt inefficient. With **React Native**, Iâ€™ve been able to:  

- Write a single codebase for both platforms, reducing development time.  
- Leverage a vast ecosystem of libraries and community support.  
- Build fast and responsive UIs using declarative components.  
- Implement video compression and optimization efficiently, as seen in Harpiee.  

With **Expo**, development is even smootherâ€”hot reloading, easy deployment, and third-party integrations make mobile app building feel intuitive.  

## Next.js: The Best of React with Performance in Mind  

When it comes to web apps, **Next.js** is my go-to choice. In projects like **the Expenses Tracker Tool and the Harpiee website**, it has been invaluable for:  

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Generation (SSG)** â€“ Essential for SEO-heavy apps.  
- **API Routes** â€“ A great way to build lightweight backend services.  
- **Optimized Performance** â€“ Automatic code-splitting and image optimization.  

With **App Router and RSC (React Server Components)** becoming the future of React, Next.js is pushing web development forward in exciting ways.  

## Nest.js: Structure and Scalability for the Backend  

Backends can easily become chaotic, but **Nest.js** provides a modular, TypeScript-friendly framework that makes API development structured and scalable. Iâ€™ve used it extensively in projects like:  

- **DMORAU** â€“ Matching algorithms, Stripe payment integration, and instant messaging.  
- **Harpiee** â€“ Handling user authentication, Supabase integration, and analytics.  

Nest.js enables:  

- **Efficient API development** using controllers, services, and decorators.  
- **TypeScript support** for safer and more maintainable code.  
- **Microservices architecture** when scaling large applications.  

## Real-World Impact: Why This Stack Works  

This stack isnâ€™t just about preferenceâ€”itâ€™s about results. Using React Native, Next.js, and Nest.js, Iâ€™ve been able to:  

- Ship products **faster** by leveraging reusable components and strong architecture.  
- Ensure **scalability**, whether handling thousands of users in a social app or managing business workflows.  
- Maintain **consistency**, keeping a clean codebase across frontend and backend.  

## Looking Ahead  

As technology evolves, so will my stack. With new advancements in **Expo's Router, React Nativeâ€™s Fabric architecture, Next.jsâ€™ App Router, and Nest.js microservices**, Iâ€™m always refining my approach. But for now, this combination remains my most powerful toolkit for building modern applications.  

If youâ€™re looking to build a **scalable, high-performance app**, Iâ€™d highly recommend giving this stack a try! ðŸš€
