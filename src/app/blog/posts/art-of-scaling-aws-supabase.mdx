Scaling a live application is more than just adding more serversâ€”it's about making smart decisions based on cost, performance, and future growth. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to scale different applications using both **AWS (EC2, RDS, S3)** and **Supabase (PostgreSQL, Storage)**. Each came with its own unique challenges, and through these experiences, Iâ€™ve gained insights into when to choose one over the other, what pitfalls to avoid, and how to optimize for performance and cost.

## The Journey of Scaling Live Apps

When I first started working on **Harpiee**, a social media app, I knew that scalability would be a key challenge. With features like **video uploads, impressions tracking, push notifications, and real-time interactions**, we needed an infrastructure that could handle large amounts of data without compromising speed. AWS became the natural choice, allowing us to leverage **EC2 for backend hosting, RDS for database management, and S3 for media storage**.  

On the other hand, for **Sociagram**, a separate social platform, I opted for **Supabase**â€”a powerful alternative that simplifies backend development with an integrated **PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage**. The goal was to move away from AWSâ€™s complex infrastructure in favor of something more developer-friendly and cost-effective.

## AWS vs. Supabase: Making the Right Choice

Each platform has its strengths, and the choice between AWS and Supabase largely depends on the scale and needs of the application. Hereâ€™s how they compare based on my experience:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: 'const { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from("users")\n  .select("*")\n  .eq("status", "active");',
            label: 'Supabase Query',
            language: 'tsx'
        },
        {
            code: 'const client = new S3Client({ region: "us-east-1" });\nawait client.send(new PutObjectCommand({\n  Bucket: "my-app-bucket",\n  Key: "video.mp4",\n  Body: file,\n}));',
            label: 'AWS S3 Upload',
            language: 'tsx'
        }
    ]}

### **When AWS is the Right Choice**  
âœ… You need fine-grained control over servers, storage, and networking.  
âœ… Your app has heavy computational needs (e.g., real-time processing, AI).  
âœ… You expect large-scale traffic and need a robust, enterprise-level solution.  
âœ… Youâ€™re prepared to manage infrastructure complexity in exchange for flexibility.  

**Example:** In **Harpiee**, we needed AWSâ€™s flexibility to handle **high-volume video processing**, secure authentication, and push notifications. The trade-off? **More setup complexity and cost.**  

### **When Supabase is the Right Choice**  
âœ… You want a **quick-to-deploy backend** with managed authentication and database.  
âœ… Youâ€™re working with a small team and want to avoid DevOps overhead.  
âœ… Your app is still growing, and you need a **cost-effective, serverless** solution.  
âœ… You donâ€™t need highly complex backend configurations.  

**Example:** For **Sociagram**, Supabase allowed me to set up **PostgreSQL, user authentication, and storage in minutes**, making it a perfect choice for a leaner, faster development process.  

## Lessons from Scaling Applications

Over time, Iâ€™ve learned that scaling isnâ€™t just about the **backend infrastructure**â€”itâ€™s also about **writing efficient code, managing data wisely, and optimizing queries**. Here are some key takeaways from my experience:

### 1. **Optimize Your Database Queries**
   - Poorly written queries can slow down even the most powerful servers.  
   - In PostgreSQL (both AWS RDS and Supabase), **indexing frequently queried columns** can improve performance significantly.  
   - Using **pagination** instead of loading large datasets at once can prevent unnecessary load on the database.  

### 2. **Use Caching Strategically**
   - **Redis or CDN caching** can significantly reduce database load and improve response times.  
   - For **Harpiee**, caching popular content helped reduce read operations on the database.  

### 3. **Monitor and Optimize Storage Costs**
   - Storing and serving media (especially videos) can get **expensive fast**.  
   - AWS S3 lifecycle policies help automatically move older files to **Glacier for cost savings**.  
   - In Supabase, keeping **image sizes optimized and deleting unused files** prevents unnecessary storage bloat.  

### 4. **Prepare for Traffic Spikes**
   - **Auto-scaling in AWS** helps handle sudden spikes, but it must be configured properly to avoid excessive costs.  
   - Supabase, being serverless, handles spikes more efficiently without requiring manual scaling.  

## Whatâ€™s Next?

The landscape of backend infrastructure is constantly evolving. While AWS provides unparalleled flexibility for large-scale applications, **Supabase is making backend development easier than ever**. Moving forward, I plan to explore **hybrid approaches**, such as:  
- Using **AWS for intensive computing workloads** and Supabase for **authentication & data storage**.  
- Experimenting with **edge computing** solutions for faster global delivery.  

## Final Thoughts

Scaling applications isnâ€™t just about choosing the right tech stackâ€”itâ€™s about understanding the trade-offs and making **strategic decisions** based on the appâ€™s needs. Whether you go with AWS for flexibility or Supabase for simplicity, the key is to **balance performance, cost, and maintainability**.
